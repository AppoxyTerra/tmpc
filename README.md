# Raygato.py and tmpc.py

These are two little utilities that I made and that I use a lot, so I thought I'd share.

## tmpc.py

> A simple python script to play quickly with code without worrying about setting up stuff.

That's where it all started. I really liked making a lot of little projects that I finished in hours, but setting up everything was usually very time-costing and I sometime lost the will to finish these little projects. I wanted some way to spawn all the things I needed, quickly, without needing any internet access, and simple enough so that I could add more templates and edit that script. So I wrote very quickly that python script 'tmpc.py' (very poorly written, at least in the first commits), which could enable me to do exactly what I needed.


## Raygato.py

Raygato (RayGaTo : Raylib Game Tool) is a shell assistant for game developement.
