 Introduction
===============



 Welcome to the Van Dwelling book. This book will cover all the information you will need to successfully live in your van or other vehicle on a part-time or full-time basis.
 



 Let's start out with a few reasons why someone would
 *want* 
 to live in their vehicle in the first place.
 






 Why live in your van full time?

*Save money on rent.* 



 Housing costs take up the largest portion of most people's budgets. If you live in an expensive area, such as San Francisco or New York, housing costs can take up 50% or more of your total income, or even be beyond what an income provides. If you live in a van, you can slash housing costs dramatically. Even in cities like San Francisco or New York, it's possible to find a place to park your vehicle for free. Even if you decide to rent a space, the costs are low, and need not be more than $100.00/month.
 




*Save money on property taxes.* 



 No property, no property taxes. Even if you still want to own a traditional home, you could buy an inexpensive home in a small community far from the city center. You could then live and work in the van in the city during the week, then commute to your place in the country on the weekends. Alternatively, you could live in your van full-time, until you save up enough to buy a house.
 




*Travel.* 



 What do you want to do when you retire? Many people will say "I'd really like to travel." But why wait until you're too old and decrepit to travel? Vans can be parked almost anywhere. If you get tired of where you're living, all you have to do is put the van into gear, and go. You can follow the seasons, follow the band, follow your whims.
 




*Live your dreams.* 



 Many people say "If I only had enough money I'd [write a screenplay, take acting lessons, travel]." Then they spend half their income paying rent, paying utility bills, buying furniture, and all the other accoutrements of fixed living. If you live in a van, most of those expenses can be dramatically reduced or eliminated. The money that would've gone to a house or car payment, could then be spent on making your dream a reality.
 




*See your friends.* 



 As people have become more mobile, family and friends are often spread out over the country. Some friends/family you never see except at reunions or weddings. With a van, you can visit your far-flung friends much more often, and you can bet they'll always have big smiles on their faces when your park your van in front of their house.
 



  





  










 History
==========

 Throughout history there are accounts of nomads, people who are not tied down to any specific place. The nomadic lifestyle has never truly disappeared, though in many industrialized countries it has become quite uncommon. Van Dwelling allows those in industrialized areas to experience a nomadic lifestyle of sorts, without giving up all modern comforts or the mobility afforded by the automobile.

 Choosing a Vehicle
=====================



 Vandwellers live in many different kinds of vehicles, ranking from Steve Robert's tricked out Winnebiko, to a Sedan, to a proper van, to a 30 feet (9.1 m) RV. The kind of vehicle most appropriate for you will depend on several factors.
 




 Size of Group

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 It goes without saying that more people will require more space. Solo dwellers can get away with living out of a small car, while families will typically want a sizable RV. Particularly large groups may fare best with a fleet consisting of multiple vehicles.
 




 Accommodations needed

 ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 If external accommodations are readily available in the region you plan on traveling, you may not need extra space in your vehicle for a shower, toilet, etc. Of course, if you're planning on going into the wilderness or even many rural areas it's better to have it and not need it, then need it and not have it.
 




 Privacy

 ]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 Privacy is a human need. If you're planning on dwelling in an urban area, consider how easy it is to conceal the inside of your vehicle for rest.
 




 Efficiency

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 If you plan on traveling long distances, the fuel efficiency of your vehicle becomes a big factor. A sedan may sip gas, while an RV will guzzle it. For those who prefer electric vehicles, electric cars are far more common then electric RVs.
 




 Reliability

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 When your vehicle is also your house, having a broken vehicle becomes a more serious issue. Reliability should be key among your criteria. Another factor to consider for those who are mechanically minded is how easy it is for you to repair your own vehicle. Some vehicles are easier to work on or find parts for then others.
 



  





  










 Vehicle Repair
=================



[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Road_trip_checks.jpg/220px-Road_trip_checks.jpg)](/wiki/File:Road_trip_checks.jpg)

 Doing some simple checks on your vehicle can mean the difference between a cheap fix in the city versus an expensive tow on the road.
 


 Van dwelling rocks, especially if you are into camping out. However, if you are going to be traveling long distances you really need to take the time to make sure all the maintenance is all taken care of. Just make sure you change the oil and keep it full if you have a leak. Take extra oil with you and other fluids as well such as transmission fluid, power steering fluid, water, antifreeze, brake fluid... you never know when you might get a leak, and if you are out in the mountains, having some of these fluids might mean the difference between stranded and moving.
 



 Also, if your van is making noises that are brand new or don't sound right get it checked out in a commercial area. There are usually big name companies that will give you a free estimate, get three estimates, and the mechanic you are most comfortable with then get the repair done. You don't want to have something break while you are traveling.
 



 Pay attention to you van, keep it clean and uncluttered this will help you focus and be aware of you van surroundings, you will see leaks, and smell odors that could be a precursor to bigger problems.
 



 If you van leaks from the seals over the doors or on the roof, get a huge tarp at a big box store and some twine. Throw the tarp over your van and over the areas that leak and tie it down to the door handles or trees. This is easy if you are camping where you don't have to be so incognito.
 



[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/RV_Service_Center%2C_Bellville_Road.JPG/220px-RV_Service_Center%2C_Bellville_Road.JPG)](/wiki/File:RV_Service_Center,_Bellville_Road.JPG)

 If you can't figure it out yourself, leave it to a pro! Mechanics are all over most of the industrialized world. Make sure to get different quotes from multiple mechanics at your local area if possible.
 


 Get yourself a good set of tools appropriate for you van IE: get a set of name brand tools as cheap ones just strip out or break or just perform badly. Make sure you get metric tools if you have a foreign model. Even if you don't know how to use the tools, at least they will be there to assist any passerby good Samaritans that want to help. \*If a stranger does try to help try to figure out if this person actually knows the basics... ask a few questions to see if they tell you the right answer re: other types of repairs. If they don't know those simple answers, don't let them tinker on your vehicle. Better to get a tow and get it to a shop. And make sure you have a cell phone for emergencies. Even if your phone doesn't have a plan, in the United States, carriers have to put 911 calls through.

Information


 | 
 Note: Much of what follows was gleaned from a post Laren Corie made to the Vandweller's list:
  |



 How can you heat your vehicle on cold, wintry nights? There are several strategies
 


1. Heavily insulate your vehicle. The more your vehicle is insulated, the less heating it will require.
2. Bundle up. It's much easier to heat you alone, than it is to heat your whole vehicle. Multiple layers of clothing (t-shirt, sweater, jacket) are better than a one single layer of the same thickness. Each layer of clothing traps a pocket of air. The trapped air prevents heat radiated by your body from exchanging with the colder external air. Layers of clothing also allow you to remove clothing as you get warmer. This helps you to avoid sweating which can cause excessive cooling as the sweat evaporates.
3. Wear a hat. Roughly 30% of body heat is radiated through an unprotected head and neck.
 [[1]](#cite_note-1)
4. Use the vehicles on-board heating. If you live in a temperate climate, and your vehicle is well-insulated, captured heat (from the on-board heater and solar radiation) may be sufficient to keep you warm enough to sleep throughout the night.
5. Build an air-to-air heat exchanger. This will allow you to vent the excess humidity and stale air from your living space without losing very much energy.
6. Store heat energy in a "thermal battery" such as a tank of heated water, Nalgene "piss jug", or a container of melted paraffin. According to Laren Corie, "...8.3 pounds of water (1 gallon) will only store 833 BTU for a 100°F rise. That is less than 1% of the energy density of propane..." Melted paraffin can store much more energy in a smaller space.
7. Set up a heat exchange circuit between your vehicles cooling system and your hot water system. Idle the engine for a while to charge your hot water tank.
8. Make a simple, vented, charcoal, or wood pellet heater, to mount on a wall, and either use it to heat the interior air, or to also put its heat into the heat storage, or both.
9. Sleep in your underwear - can be a problem in the event of a nighttime disturbance.
10. Personally, I think you don't need any of these methods if you have a good SLEEPING BAG - which is way more effective even than wearing a bunch of layers along with having a bunch of covers. I've been living the van life for 2 and a half years so far and have got it down to a science. - From anonymous vanman



 You can also combine all of the above approaches. Here's how Laren Corie describes one potential setup:
 



> 
> 
>  At this point [all of the above] may not seem practical, but I can assure you that it was a very practical approach for my Centauri Van, which was a small diesel, box van. The walls were an insulated sandwich of aluminum surfaces, and 1 1/4" of urethane foam (approx R 8-10).
>  
> 
> 
> 
>  I figured that two 20 gal tanks (under the bed platform) plus the eleven gallons in the heat exchanger tank, would be enough to get me through an eight hour night of 0°F. It would not keep the van at 70°F but it would keep it warm enough for comfortable sleeping. On nights that
> only went down into the thirties, it would stay toasty. This also considered Reflectix covers over all of the windows. Fifty gallons of water weighs over 400 pounds, but you need to carry some water anyway. Paraffin containers, could be arranged to heat the bed platform, instead of the interior air, and would require a lot less storage, while you normal water storage could be used to heat the interior air.
>  
> 
> 
> 
>  A two liter bottle of paraffin (votive candle wax)heated to just over 130°F will give off about 400 BTU as it cools to body temperature. It will then give off another 100BTUs or so, as it cools down to the temperature that the van air will cool to.
>  
> 
> 
> 
>  Two liters of water will only give off about 4 1/3 BTU per °F, so maybe 80 BTUs as it drops from
> 130° down to 50°F.
>  
> 
> 
> 
>  A two liter bottle of melted wax will store about five times as much heat as a two liter bottle of water heated to the same temperature, and it will also weigh considerably less. Either one can be heated all the way up to the approx 180°F that the engine coolant gets to.

 Cooling tends to be more difficult in general than heating. When you are cold you can add more layers, but it is more circuitous to cool off when warm.
During the summer, most vehicles heat up due to the greenhouse effect. This is very unpleasant to wake up to.
 


* Block sunlight from entering the vehicle, preferably using white material on the outside of the windows.
* Experiment with some method to actively circulate air into the vehicle.
* Park in the shade
* Sleep outside the vehicle if possible
* Install a 12V fan. Check the power consumption
* Build or purchase an air conditioner that works by evaporating water such as a swamp cooler or evaporative cooler. Note that this works in inverse proportion to the relative humidity. Heat of vaporization is 5 calories per gram. It takes 5 times the amount of energy to vaporize water as it does to heat it from 0 to 100 degrees Celsius. So they are really effective. (It appears, however, that some swamp coolers output humid, cool air; which in most climates except exceptionally dry ones will not cool you because the water vapor will condense on you heating you up. You should run that humid air through a heat exchanger, exhaust the humid air, and blow the cool and less humid air over you.) Apparently, simply cooling your face has a large effect.
* Sleep in your underwear - can be a problem in the event of a nighttime disturbance.
* Use a peltier junction cooling device (such as found in 12V coolers). There is a product that cools just your neck, or you could circulate cooled water over you

 Ground source heating/cooling utilizes thermal energy from the earth to heat or cool a house. Unlike the temperature of air which fluctuates throughout the seasons, the temperature slightly below ground is consistent year round. A geothermal system utilizes this phenomenon to control the temperature of the house. The system consists of three elements: an underground piping system, a heat pump and a distribution system for the house.
 [[2]](#cite_note-2)
 During wintertime, the temperature below ground is warmer than in the house. This heat is absorbed by the fluid in the underground pipes which circulates to the house. The heat pump utilizes refrigerants which extract this energy and distributes it through the ventilation system of the house. During the summer, this process is reversed. The heat pump extracts the thermal energy from the house where it gets sent below ground. In this configuration, the earth acts as a heat sink. A ground source heating/cooling system only requires a small amount of electricity to power the heat pump which is why it is so efficient. Unlike traditional systems, the heat is not created through a combustion process but simply extracted from the ground.

 A thermoelectric (TE) solid state heat pump operates based on the Peltier effect,
 [[4]](#cite_note-4)
 in which electrical energy is converted to thermal energy. A thermoelectric module consists of a thermoelectric material, typically semiconductors such as Bismuth telluride (Bi
 2 
 Te
 3 
 ),
 [[5]](#cite_note-5)
 sandwiched between two ceramic plates joined with electrical interconnects. When a voltage is applied to the device, heat is transferred from one side to the other, typically against the temperature gradient. The direction of heat travel depends on the sign of the voltage, and thus the device is capable of providing both cooling and heating. The term “solid state” refers to the fact that the device has no moving parts, thus enabling it to run fairly quietly and requiring minimal maintenance.
 



 TE heat pumps operate purely on electricity, so precise temperature control can be achieved as we can directly measure and control the current flow into the system. To date, TE solid state heat pumps are primarily used in cooling applications, whether it’s for electronic components that require specific constant temperatures, or portable coolers for personal use as in furnace filters. Large scale applications however, in this case the heating and cooling of an entire residential house, are extremely rare or almost nonexistent, due to the potential cost and complexity of the overall system.

 Going to where the climate is nice is a surprisingly simple yet effective option.
 


 One of the primary advantages of van dwelling is mobility. If one has the freedom with job and friends/family, they can simply drive to locations that are warmer in winter and cooler in summer. The cost of fuel should be considered of course; but it may be offset the by a reduction in the cost of fuel required to stay comfortable. Then there is the psychological boost of always being comfortable, and seeing new locations.

 Selecting a Parking Spot
 


 The choice of a parking spot is one of the most critical decisions a vehicle dweller will make. The choice of parking spot for a night will have much to do with safety, security, quality of sleep, and avoidance of police. Considering the fact that more and more communities are passing laws that make it illegal to sleep in a vehicle, stealth is of utmost importance if in the city. If one is boondocking in the wilderness, this is of little consideration. So, the choice of parking spot creates an incredible challenge. Let us consider several different scenarios, and analyze the pros and cons of each.
 




 Forested Wilderness

 From the standpoint of safety, security, and a quiet night's sleep, nothing is likely to be better than a heavily forested location miles and miles from civilization, parked next to a creek or river. The serene surrounding and gentle sound of flowing water quickly settles me down and allows me to get right to sleep.
 



 Finding such spots is not difficult in some parts of the country, such as the Rocky Mountain region, Pacific Northwest, and central Appalachians, but may be much more difficult in other parts of the United States. Your mileage may vary in other countries.
 



 A significant downside to living in these areas is also the reason you are there: The remoteness. Being so remote also means you are far from gas stations and grocery stores and other conveniences of modern life.
 




 Desert and Plains

 Parking in a remote area typically avoids problems from other people.
 


 There is a lot of this land and many people congregate for certain seasons in these open areas. You can usually be closer to civilization and have more of a community atmosphere, but noise and other things that come along with being around other
 *Homo sapiens* 
 can be a negative. I have never done this before, so somebody else could fill this in better.

 City Camping: Residential

 When van dwelling in an urban environment, you pretty much have three choices of places to park: Residential, commercial, and industrial areas.
 



 The beauty of residential areas is that it is usually common to have cars on the street at night, so it is potentially easy to blend in, depending on what kind of vehicle you have. It is less common in wealthier neighborhoods to see vehicles on the street, and you should also be aware of crime rates in the neighborhood you choose to inhabit.
 



 Living in a large cargo van makes me shy away from parking in most residential areas, as the vehicle just doesn't fit in as well.
 




 City Camping: Commercial Areas

 An RV parked in an urban area.
 


 Retail and business sectors are my preferred parking areas for my cargo van. It is not unusual to see large cargo vans, box vans, and other commercial-looking vehicles in these parts of town, since many businesses use them as service and delivery vehicles. When stealth is of the utmost importance, commercial/business parks are the cream of the crop. Not only are larger vehicles commonly parked overnight in these parts of town, it is also common to see smaller cars in these areas because there are night crews doing stocking, cleaning, customer service, etc.
It also helps to strap a disguise on your van. So if you park by a plumbing supply it helps to put magnets on van that says "Bobs Plumbing" and add PVC pipe on the roof.
 




 City Camping: Industrial Sectors

 Industrial zones are typically noisier and dirtier than most other parts of cities. These areas are also more likely to have 24-hour operations, which mean more people coming and going during the night. Private security is also more abundant near industrial facilities. This increases the likelihood of somebody seeing you come and go, or of having your window tapped on in the middle of the night. In large metropolitan areas, crime rates also tend to escalate near large industrial areas. To me, these are all reasons to avoid industrial parts of town.

 If one is driving an RV, there may be campsites that allow one to park without worry of concealment. These sites also often provide a variety of amenities. Of course the downside to this service is that it costs money, which adds up to considerable amounts for long term van dwelling.
 






 Summary: The Best Parking Place?

 I personally find the best possible parking spot to be a quiet, low-traffic dead end piece of road with several other vehicles parked nearby on the border between a middle-class residential neighborhood and a large office or retail park. My van typically fits in perfectly in this sort of place and I tend to feel safe and secure knowing other people are nearby.

 Finding the perfect parking space can be a challenge.
 


 Many websites offer tips on parking. In general parking relates to the concept of movement discipline. Have checklists in the vehicle (a good idea in general) like those of an airline pilots, and go through your checklist each time you move the vehicle.
 



 Here are a few discreet parking strategies.
 



 With intent to leave:
 


* Park in areas of high visibility to deter theft.



 With intent to stay:
 


* If you have a cohort, they can park the van for you practically anywhere that allows overnight parking. To external observers it would appear as though your cohort had simply parked the van and left. If you have a van with a barrier you may consider simply getting in the back of the van to start with (although that may arouse suspicion), or driving into an alley or some unobservable place and transfer to the back there.
* Park in the very early hours of the morning, and shut your door as though you had left.
* Park so as to obscure visibility of your entrance.
* Park the van as if to leave it overnight and return to it later. Be aware of who is watching you. Not recommended in residential areas where you cannot be sure if you are being watched, except for late at night.
* Always park near other vans.
* In winter park in sunlight, and summer in shade. Try to find areas which will consistently be in the sun or shade as the day progresses.


* Avoid parking in front of someone's house in a residential neighborhood, unless you plan on leaving early in the morning. Some residential areas that are mainly apartment complexes are better, where the people living there don't own the property, but people who own their own homes tend to believe that the curbside in front of their house is their property too, even though it is city property, and they might call the police on you.
* If you need to be in a city, try parking near a college or university. It is borderline acceptable that some college students are poor and live in vehicles, and most of the facilities on college campuses such as bathrooms, gym showers, and library are available to anyone.



 Also truck stops, rest areas and Walmart lots are usually good spots to park and sleep.
 



  





  










 Police
=========



 Van Dwellers may find themselves interacting with law enforcement officers, for either good or bad reasons.
 




 Illegally parked

[edit source](/w/index.php?title=Van_Dwelling/Police&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Illegally parked") 

 ]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 If at all possible, one should never park illegally. In the event that one has parked illegal zone (
 **not recommended** 
 ), most officers will discontinue in progress citations if you bring to their attention that the vehicle, is in fact, occupied. The chances of success in this situation are increased if you act confused, apologetic, and give the impression that you plan to move the vehicle subsequently. (Observations surveyed summer of 2004 while living in a 1998 Black Honda Passport at the University of California at Davis.)
 



 In areas with stricter enforcement this method may be much less effective. Do not rely on it to park willy nilly.
 




 Crime

 It can be handy to have the non-emergency number of the local police in whatever area you happen to be passing through so that should you be a victim of a crime, you can report it.

* Always park in areas of high traffic and visibility to deter theft.
* Disguise the van to be an old work van. Leave "evidence" of it being a work van, such as various trade tools in the front. Keep it dirty. (Although also keep in mind that if the van appears to be full of expensive tools, it can attract the attention of thieves.)
* Van should pass point-blank review
* Dress like a worker particular to that trade.
* Put a for sale sign in the window to purchase cover (plus if someone is willing to pay 2X retail you are in luck!)
* Buy an automotive security system. Wire it so that you are able to set it off. That way, when someone comes near the van, and you assess that they mean it no good, you can set it off.
* Hide your important items so that a thief that goes through your van without stealing it outright will not find much.

 Even on the road, it is possible to eat well!
 


 Fuel, water, and space are very limited in a van or small vehicle. Therefore, it can sometimes be a challenge to eat healthily on the road.
 



 There are a wide variety of foods that can be eaten without cooking:
 



 Fruit -- bananas, apples, oranges, grapefruit, grapes,
 



 Vegetables -- broccoli, cauliflower, string beans, tomatoes, "spinach in a bag".
 



 Breakfast cereals -- Advantages: convenient, tasty, portable, stores well for moderate lengths of time (a few months). Disadvantages: somewhat expensive, full of sugar (with a few exceptions).
 



 Canned soup -- Canned soups are relatively inexpensive, durable, don't require refrigeration, and can be eaten cold or heated. Disadvantages: often high in salt, more expensive than self-prepared foods.
 



 Tips to reduce fuel usage:
 


* Presoak beans and grains overnight before cooking. This will soften them up and reduce the time required for cooking.
* Use an insulated container to "slow cook" your food.
* Use waste engine heat. As Laren Corie writes: "Even the dash heater can put out temperatures high enough for a lot of cooking, if you build a frame to direct the air over and around the food or container." It is even possible to cook
 *on* 
 the engine block. After running for any length of time, the engine block should be hot enough to cook on.

 Newspaper/garbage bags
 



 Kitty Litter - Buy litter that comes in its own bucket. Use the kitty shovel to form a depression in the litter so your contribution doesn't touch the side walls of the bucket. Make your contribution. Use your kitty shovel (or an inside out zip lock style baggy over our hand like a glove)to cover it up. Either immediately lift it out or let it set up a bit. Remove it from the kitty litter bucket with your kitty shovel or inside out zip lock style baggy worn like a glove over your hand. Zip close the baggy and deposit it in a dumpster. Drive with the lid closed on the bucket and placed so sudden stops won't tip it over.
 



 The simplest method is to lay out some newspapers. After defecating, wrap it in newspaper, then tie it up in a grocery bag. Dispose of it in the nearest garbage can or dumpster.
 



 Newspaper method #2, wrap in newspaper with sawdust (to absorb moisture) and a handful of soil, store outside where it can dry up w/o smelling, turns into a humanure compost burrito, yum!
 



 Re-closable jug such as water or milk. Ladies use a funnel which is rinsed clean with water before storing.

 This is the least water consuming method, and is the easiest method for keeping clean if you're living in a car or other small space.
 



 You can keep reasonably clean at minimum, you will need about 1 quart of water. Heat half the water to boiling on a camp stove. Pour about a 2 cups of water into a bowl, and add a enough cold water to make the temperature comfortable. Wet a small dishrag or sponge with the water. Take off your top, and drape a towel over your shoulders. Wet your hair with the dishrag. Pour a small droplet of soap into your palm and work it into your hair. Repeat until you have a lather. Use as little soap as necessary, so that you don't have to use much water to rinse it out. Leave the soap in your hair to soak while you lather up your face and torso. Bend over a bowl, and pour water over your hair so it drains into the bowl.

 A plastic bladder which is clear on one side and black on the other. It can be placed on the dashboard or anywhere in the sun to warm the water. Hang it from something(a tree or part of your van) and the water flows through a tube and out through a shower head. If you prefer to shower outside of your van be sure to find a secluded spot such as behind a grocery store or strip mall. Showering inside a plastic rain poncho can prevent indecent exposure. Fast drying travel towels composed of synthetic materials are available and often preferable over slow to dry cotton towels. Nearly identical towels are available for a much lower price in the automotive or housecleaning section of most grocery and big-box stores.

 There are commercial product for showering in a vehicle, typically designed for truckers. Its a little expensive at around $300.
 



  





  










 Exercise
===========



 Keeping fit on the road can be more difficult, since you don't have a lot of room to store bulky training equipment.
 



 The ideal exercise equipment for van dwelling would be:
 


1. Lightweight
2. Compact
3. Inexpensive
4. Durable
5. Effective
6. Multi-use
7. Simple



 And such exercise equipment exists! It's your own body.
You don't need anything but your own flesh to stay in shape.
 



 The primary question is whether you want others to know that you live in your van. If that is not an option, then you cannot exercise right next to it. You will have to move some distance away or go to a nearby park or playground.
 



 You will need some kind of workout outfit, which you can pick up on the cheap, because wearing jeans or some other non-sportive clothes will make you look more of a homeless person in the park than a sport-minded individual.
 



 The simplest regimen of 3 sets of 20 pushups, 3 sets of 20 situps, 2x12 chinups, and brisk walking or jogging for 15 minutes will give you the necessary workout to maintain health.
 



 For better shape, you will need to plan out a more stern regimen.
 



 A simple online search for calisthenics will provide you with enough information to plan out your exercise routine.
 



 Three times a week is the minimum exercise you should get.
 



 If you can work out next to your van, this will save you time and effort.
 



 Remember, staying in shape means you'll live longer and healthier.

* Register at a (preferably 24 hour) health club.
* A magnetic resistance bike which doubles as a computer workstation.
* A soccer ball.
* An elastic workout device.



 Yoga is an excellent form of exercise and you can do it in the center of your van if you stack things on the seats. Also removing one of your back seats will allow for more space.

 While travel can be exciting, there are also challenges that come along with the fun. One of these challenges can be keeping clothes clean. Not only may clothes look dirty, microbes and bacteria may start to grow on clothes that are stained with food spills and sweat that comes from even the most basic daily activities. Dirt and bacteria also causes the fabric of clothing to break down more quickly, causing clothes to wear out sooner. Also, living in a small space (especially with other people), can sometimes make these smells seem overpowering, so keeping clothes clean may help prevent underlying irritability between travel partners. Also wearing clean clothes generally makes a person seem more acceptable to others.

* Many folks simply use local commercial laundromats available in most towns. Many truck stops also offer laundry facilities.


* Most newer campgrounds also have laundromats for guests' use.


* You could go "the natural way" and wash your items in a river or lake (be sure to use eco-friendly soap), or perhaps in a kiddie swimming pool or large bucket, then letting them dry on your vehicle, bushes, or on a rock.


* Camping supply stores offer choices of appliances to wash small loads of laundry. There are both electrical and non-powered options.


* Some people make homemade washers out of a five gallon bucket and a plunger; plans are available through a YouTube search.



  





  










 Storage
==========



 Storage in a van is as personal as the user makes it for their own needs and depending upon the space available inside of their vehicle.
 



 Most Vandwellers have their bed put up onto some type of frame, which gives them much more internal storage space. Depending upon the layout and the mattress chosen, the space has many possibilities. If one mattress is used (such as a futon), generally it's easier to get beneath if it can be moved to one side or front into a couch, then the storage beneath it can be accessed. Sometimes long drawers are made to pull out behind the van/minivan. Two or more bed cushions can be used which will allow for even easier access to the floor storage.
 



 Other forms of storage can be built in cabinets, plastic tubs, or re-purposed plastic file cabinets.
 



 Small items can be put into hanging racks such as are made for shoes or use in bathrooms.
 



 Many ideas are available through YouTube searches on van dwelling and on Pinterest.
 



  





  










 Internet
===========



 Internet access is everywhere, so this is pretty easy to take care of. Membership at the local library will give you some time of free Internet access. If you have the money to patronize the business, many coffee shops and delis will have one or two computers for their customers to use.
 



 If you can afford it, a laptop computer with WiFi support will allow you to get free internet at many chain stores, public libraries, etc. Purchasing a high gain directional wireless antenna can make it easier to acquire signals of Wi-Fi intended for public use.
 



 The ultimate solution is a laptop with a satellite modem, enabling you to connect from anywhere in the world. However, this can cost some money, particularly with an ISP to deal with.
 



 There are also some cellular Internet options that are increasingly cheap and fast.
 



  





  










 Power Systems
================




|  |
| --- |
|  |



 Consult a marine store for advice on power systems. In general many problems applying to van dwelling are equally applicable to boating and vice versa.
 



 Power will probably be hard to come by without some money. That said, you can try going to some place where old batteries are discharged. Supposedly, if a commercial grade computer UPS dies, sometimes it will be only be one of the batteries that have died, and the others are salvageable. Many products support to be able to restore batteries killed through misuse, and not the normal abrupt battery death.

 Depending on your needs you may or may not even need power. If you are in survival mode and without cash, you may not even need any power. My goal is to be able to study and learn and contribute back to the internet via programming. For this I need a permanent and cheap way of living. Hence my van is essentially a computing pod and therefore has moderate power needs.

 A van setup to be powered by solar and wind while stationary.
 


 Solar power generation is expensive but recalcitrant.
 



 The panels were more fragile then I expected.
 



 Putting solar panels on top of the van blows cover and makes you are target of theft and vandalism. I put them in the passenger compartment right behind the seats, and there is an unquantified charge on the charge controller. The biggest problem is that they are detectable at point blank. If you have a cargo van with racks you can try hiding them in a ladder or something, and/or placing a tarp over them that you can control showing them. Another technique is to blend and mask them on the roof, maybe using wire or something that obscures visibility, to the detriment of efficiency.
 



 If you are out camping then you can simply let them outside provided they don't exceed the scope of your security system.

 Dating
=========



 The question of dating for Van Dwellers really has two sides to it. First, it can possibly scare some people when they discover they are dating a van dweller. Second, it can possibly scare a van dweller to be dating.
 



 Many books about dating provide advice that is applicable to van dwellers, just as it is to the rest of society. Basically, before even contemplating dating, there are some things to consider:
 


1. Do you have a way to maintain good personal hygiene?
2. Do you have a steady way to make money? (Printing your own does not count).
3. Do you have a stable place to live?



 These are important questions to ask before beginning dating. It will be very difficult to get dates (or at least second dates) without good personal hygiene. Dating can be very well done on the cheap, but it will occasionally require some amount of money.
 



 The third question may be of most interest to some van dwellers. A very small percentage of the population is open to the idea of dating somebody that they view as "homeless," even though you may not consider yourself homeless. As such, you probably only have 3 options:
 


1. Only date people that accept your chosen mode of living.
2. Just don't let people know.
3. Don't date.



 Since you're reading this, you probably don't consider #3 an option. Finding people that fit #1 may be difficult, but not impossible. Thus, we go to #2.
 



 Since many people consider honesty to be one of those big cornerstones of a successful relationship, this one can get a bit tricky. Things can get even worse when a dating partner starts to question "why we never go back to your place." Therefore, it may be advisable to let somebody know about your situation after a certain number of dates if you plan on pursuing a steady relationship.
 



 This is strictly a personal philosophy, but I would tell a potential partner somewhere around date number five, if I had any inclination of pursuing a long term relationship. My approach would be to start a discussion about the desire for personal freedom and the escape of rampant consumerism and the rat race, and use that as a segue into explaining my living choice.
 



 Of course, if you pick up your date in at his/her house in your van, then they might perhaps be able to figure it out on their own and simply ask. :)
 



 Considering the fact that you have chosen this mode of living for one reason or another, you may actually end up finding potential partners amongst people that are of similar mindset and inclination. If this is an idea you are open to, consider plugging into your local "alternative" community. Most cities have some semblance of a community of people interested in simpler lifestyles, reduced consumerism, and some sort of activism related to such concepts. Participating in groups, activities, and gatherings for these sort of things could provide a plugin to a pool of eligible partners that are open to the van dwelling lifestyle.
 



  





  










 Children
===========



 Van Dwelling can be difficult for those with children. Every child is different, and some will appreciate the variety of scenery and lifestyle, while others will yearn for stable living with friends and family in close proximity. If you are a parent, it is your responsibility to make the best choice for your child.

 Safety
 

 Risks acceptable for an adult may not be acceptable while a child is in tow. Furthermore general healthcare, dental access, etc may be more difficult without the same family doctor who is knowledgeable of their history presiding.
 

 Childcare
 

 Inconsistent childcare availability may preclude vanlife with a child.
 

 Socialization
 

 When you move, their friends won't come with them. Furthermore some family may be hard to reach while on the road if you previously lived near them.
 

 Educational variation
 

 Quality of schools can vary on the road. Homeschooling may be an option, but if all caregivers are away frequently, education will suffer.
 



 Benefits

 ]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




 Broaden worldview
 

 The child will see a larger and more diverse section of the world then if they grow up in one place.
 

 Life skills
 

 Being constantly on the move necessitates acquiring a variety of skills to make daily life easier. Skills such as navigation, repair, and others may be picked up while on the move.
 

 Socilization
 

 The flip side to socialization being a downside is that van dwelling does present an opportunity for your child to meet far away family members, should you make it a point to go visit them.

 You may consider shorter excursions as a vacation instead of a lifestyle. This allows you to get some the benefits of van life, and see if the child would like it. Remember that a child that likes a short term on the road may not appreciate a permanent transition to van dwelling.

It's given me ideas for making my own high top. selecting the right upholstery materials and it's given me the confidence to do the whole conversion myself."
