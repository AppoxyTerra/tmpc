 A private water body is a water feature that is owned or controlled by an individual or a group of individuals, rather than by the public or the government. Private water bodies can be natural or artificial, and they can vary in size, shape, and function. Some examples of private water bodies are:
 


* **Private ground water wells** 
 : These are wells that tap into the underground water sources called aquifers. Private ground water wells usually supply water to an individual residence or a small community. They are often used in rural areas where public water systems are not available or reliable. Private ground water wells require regular testing and maintenance to ensure the quality and safety of the water.
* **Cisterns** 
 : These are tanks or containers that store rainwater or other sources of water for later use. Cisterns can be above ground or underground, and they can be made of various materials such as metal, plastic, concrete, or stone. Cisterns can provide water for drinking, irrigation, fire protection, or other purposes. Cisterns also require regular testing and maintenance to prevent contamination and leakage.
* **Larger private water systems** 
 : These are systems that serve more than one residence or property, such as a subdivision, a mobile home park, a campground, or a school. Larger private water systems may use ground water wells, surface water sources (such as lakes or rivers), or both. Larger private water systems are regulated by the state or local authorities and must comply with certain standards and regulations.
* **Ponds** 
 : These are small bodies of water that are usually shallow and still. Ponds can be natural or artificial, and they can be used for various purposes such as fishing, swimming, wildlife habitat, or aesthetic appeal. Ponds can also help control erosion and runoff on the land. Ponds need regular care and management to prevent algae growth, invasive species, and water quality issues.
* **Lakes** 
 : These are larger bodies of water that are usually deep and have waves. Lakes can be natural or artificial, and they can also be used for various purposes such as boating, skiing, fishing, swimming, or recreation. Lakes can also provide habitat for many aquatic plants and animals. Lakes need regular care and management to prevent pollution, sedimentation, eutrophication, and invasive species.
* **Streams** 
 : These are flowing bodies of water that move from higher to lower elevations. Streams can be natural or artificial, and they can vary in size, speed, and direction. Streams can provide water for irrigation, hydroelectric power, or drinking. Streams can also support biodiversity and ecological processes. Streams need regular care and management to prevent erosion, flooding, contamination, and habitat loss.
* **Wetlands** 
 : These are areas where the land is saturated with water for part or all of the year. Wetlands can be natural or artificial, and they can include marshes, swamps, bogs, fens, or peatlands. Wetlands can provide many benefits such as water filtration, flood control, carbon storage, wildlife habitat, and recreation. Wetlands need regular care and management to prevent drainage, filling, pollution, and degradation.
* **Fountains** 
 : These are structures that spray water into the air for decorative or functional purposes. Fountains can be indoor or outdoor, and they can be made of various materials such as stone, metal, glass, or plastic. Fountains can enhance the beauty and ambiance of a place, as well as provide cooling and humidifying effects. Fountains need regular care and maintenance to prevent clogging, corrosion, leakage, and damage.
* **Pools** 
 : These are artificial basins that hold water for swimming or other aquatic activities. Pools can be above ground or in ground, and they can be made of various materials such as concrete, fiberglass, vinyl liner, or tile. Pools can provide fun and exercise for people of all ages and abilities. Pools need regular care and maintenance to prevent algae growth, bacterial infection, chemical imbalance, and structural problems.
