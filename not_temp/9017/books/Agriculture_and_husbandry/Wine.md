 Humans have cultivated Wine since ancient times. The drink is mentioned quite often by ancient Greeks and Romans, and it also appears in a number of religious texts.

 Grape vines can live for well over 100 years. The number of grapes grown is highest when the vine is under about 20 years old. However some growers insist that older vines give superior grapes.

 The specific region in which a wine is grown has a noted effect on the resulting grape, and by extension the wines made from it.

 Climate determines where grapes will grow. More then that, climate determines where grapes will merely grow adequately, or where they will excel.

 Winemakers pay special attention to the soil in which grapes are grown. For example in France the makers of Champagne famously use chalky soil for growing their grapes.

* 4 kg dark black grapes;
* 4 L water (boiled & cooled);
* 4 kg sugar;
* 2 eggs – whites only;
* 2 ounces [60 mL] of liquid yeast or 2 tbspns [15 mL] of dry yeast granuals;

 Clean and wash grapes well removing stalks, crush nicely with hand until you get a good purple colour. Place the crushed grapes in a ceramic jar with half the quantity of sugar (i.e. 2 kgs Sugar), add water, egg whites, yeast & wheat – mix well & keep airtight for 21 days – stirring well every alternative day. After 21 days strain away the grape pulp mixture, add the balance sugar to the wine – mix well & keep airtight for another 21 days to ferment. Now filter the wine (you could use a muslin cloth & strain the wine) – keep aside. Take a wok add the sugar kept for colouring (1/2 –3/4 Cup) – place on fire & go on stirring till the sugar melts & becomes dark brown/black in colour - but do not allow it to burn – now add about 5-7 tbsps. Of hot water to this syrup little @ a time & mix well, add this syrup to the wine & mix well – store the wine in a clean jar & use.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 A number of regions worldwide are noted for their wine production. The unique environmental and social factors involved in a region's wine production are called
 *Terroir* 
 by wine enthusiasts.
 



 Because of this concept many wines associated with a region, especially wines that share a name with a region, are considered to only be true examples of that sort of wine if they originate there. For example, if one made "Champagne" on the moon, it would not be considered Champagne by many, and in many countries Champagne can only legally be called "Champagne" if it originated in the Champagne region of France.

 Food and Wine Pairing
========================



 Wine has always been a drink to match with food. An ideal pairing of the wine's unique characteristics can help make a truly memorable meal.
 



 Some examples of wine and food pairings include:
 


* Riesling with a spicy dish. The sweetness and acidity of the wine matches perfectly with the spice in the food.
* Hearty red, such as cabernet sauvignon with steak or lamb. Always a classic - the two are a classic combination.
* Sauvignon blanc with a fish; the clean taste of sauvignon blanc matches well with a simply prepared fish dish.



 The following table will show some of the styles of wines, the styles attributes and finally a classic food match. The next section will describe additional matches that can be made for specific types of food.
 




| 
 Wine
  | 
 Style
  | 
 Food Match
  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
 Sauvignon Blanc - Bordeaux White
  | 
 Clean taste, moderate acidity
  | 
 Simple Fish Dishes, as an aperitif
  |
| 
 Cabernet Sauvignon - Hearty Red
  | 
 Deep flavor, some tannins, ripe fruit
  | 
 Roasted, grilled meat

 Parmigiano Reggiano
  | 
 Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Carbet Sauvignon, merlot, Shiraz
  |
| 
 Swiss
  |

 Generally, the stronger the cheese, the stronger the wine should be.

 Various styles of wine glasses.
 

* Proper wine glasses help ensure a good drinking experience.
* Chill white or sparkling wine for at least 1 hour prior to serving. Decant red wines prior to guests' arrival.
* Wine charms can help guests distinguish their glasses. Alternatively, one may use marked wine glasses for the same purpose.

* Serve cheese at room temperature; this brings out their fullest flavors.
* Arrange the food items 30-60 minutes before the guests arrive. Cheese should be brought out three hours before serving.
* Cover the platters with plastic wrap to keep them fresh, but remove just prior to serving.
* Leave space between cheeses to keep flavors from blending. On the same idea, each cheese should have its own knife or spreader.



  





  










 Storage
==========



[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Home_wine_rack_-_side_view%2C_Queensland%2C_Australia.jpg/220px-Home_wine_rack_-_side_view%2C_Queensland%2C_Australia.jpg)](/wiki/File:Home_wine_rack_-_side_view,_Queensland,_Australia.jpg)

 A home wine rack.
 


 Proper wine storage is a very important thing. When one typically purchases large quantities of assorted wines, it is natural that among all other reasons, future consumption is the key. Proper wine storage can lead to a great many years of future enjoyment. Wine storage also provides time for immature vintages to develop into something special. Correct wine storage provides the wine lover the ability to collect and store large qualities of there favorite wines to be enjoyed for years to come.
 



 When considering a large investment in wine, the wine lover must consider the method in which he stores his wine. Improper storage can damage wine and thus diminish the possibility of enjoyment.
 



 Chiefly, the purchaser will consider where he will store his or her wine. Here, he has options. Either he might store it at home or hire an outside service to store the wine for him. The wine lover must protect the wine from the elements.
 



[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Schramsberg_Vineyards%2C_July_2019-7579%2B7580.jpg/220px-Schramsberg_Vineyards%2C_July_2019-7579%2B7580.jpg)](/wiki/File:Schramsberg_Vineyards,_July_2019-7579%2B7580.jpg)

 A wine cellar.
 


 While 90% of all wine is meant to be consumed within one year, a true connoisseur and collector may wish to consider an additional investment in a wine cellar. Significant thought and planning should go into this process. These are the things that should be considered in this process.
 


* Location of the wine cellar


* Temperature of the wine cellar


* Humidity and ventilation of the area


* Composition of the floor


* Lighting of the space



 The location of the wine cellar is very important. When underground, it is best that it’s a room that is facing to the north. This is necessary as this wall receives the minimum amount of solar radiation during the day thus causing less retention of heat. The northern part of the perimeter of this room must not be adjacent to a road nor railway and made of stone or brick. The wine cellar must not be subject to unnecessary movement or vibrations. Vibrations can disturb and damage wine.
 



 The wine ideally, must be stored at temperatures between 10°-14° Celsius. The wine must be kept cool. This is done by keeping the wine underground and minimizing exposure to solar radiation.
 



 Humidity must be controlled in order to keep the cork moist and functioning. A functioning cork maintains the integrity of the wine. The humidity should be between 70-75%. This level of humidity would cause mold to form in a normal house.
 



 A floor of earth or sand is important, as this also helps to reduce the level of vibrations in the room.
 



 Lastly, the lighting must originate from unscented candles. Neon or fluorescent lighting cannot be considered as they kill wine. The candles used must be unscented as a scented candle will foul the wine.
Once these 5 considerations are undertaken, a new problem emerges. That is, what to stock the wine cellar with. While this question is beyond the scope of this paper, it is sincerely wished that everyone stock their cellars with all sorts of wine that they enjoy. This is certainly the intention of the entire effort.
